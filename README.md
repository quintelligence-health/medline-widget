MIDAS MEDLINE Widget 
======

The MEDLINE custom widget is a component of the [MIDAS platform](http://www.midasproject.eu/), side-by-side with other widgets like the MEDLINE custom widget, the heatmap ot the proprietary data, the Twitter bot campaign monitor, etc. In this reppository we release the code for this MEDLINE custom widget and describe how it can be build and interact with other widgets. 
This custom widget is available through the MIDAS platform to explore the scientific articles in MEDLINE. It relies on an elasticSearch instance to which the [MEDLINE dataset was loaded](https://github.com/quintelligence-health/medline-dashboard/wiki/Cleaning,-preprocessing-and-loading-the-data), and in the [SearchPoint](https://github.com/lstopar/SearchPoint) system, which is also available Open Source.
